# Support Vector Machines Project

Welcome to my Support Vector Machine Project! In this project, we will be analyzing the famous Iris flower dataset using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Dataset
The Iris flower dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Structure
- **Data Visualization**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn and matplotlib.
- **Model Training**: Training an SVM classifier using scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using confusion matrix and classification report.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for better performance.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Support-Vector-Machines-Project.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the project:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Support_Vector_Machines_Project.ipynb
    ```

## Results
The SVM model achieved high accuracy in classifying the Iris species. Further parameter tuning using GridSearchCV helped in optimizing the model performance.
